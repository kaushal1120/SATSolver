Front End:
1. The main function in java file FrontEnd.java in package ai.sat.frontend runs the FrontEnd program for the adventure maze problem.
2. The input for this FrontEnd program is defined in SATSolver-master/src/io_files/maze_input.txt. Replace the contents
of this file to generate the atoms and clauses for any other adventure maze problem.
3. The output file generated by this program is dpll_input.txt which is generated in SATSolver-master/src/io_files/.

Davis-Putnam Procedure:
1. The main function in java file SatSolver.java in package ai.sat.dpll runs the Davis-Putnam procedure for satisifiability.
2. The input for the davis-putnam program is defined in SATSolver-master/src/io_files/dpll_input.txt. Replace the contents
of this file to run the dpll procedure on any other input.
3. The output file generated by the dpll program is dpll_output.txt which is generated in SATSolver-master/src/io_files/.

Back End:
1. The main function in java file BackEnd.java in package ai.sat.backend runs the BackEnd program for the adventure maze problem.
2. The input for this BackEnd program is defined in SATSolver-master/src/io_files/dpll_output.txt. Replace the contents
of this file to generate the domain solution path from the dpll valuations of any other adventure maze problem.
3. The output from this module comes on the standard output.

To run the above programs:
1. Unzip SATSolver-master.zip.
2. cd SATSolver-master
3. Replace the contents of the respective input files in src/io_files to change the input on which either of the 
programs are run.
